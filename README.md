It appears there's an issue with accessing the contents of the `go-electrum-client` zip file, preventing me from directly inspecting its contents to create a README.md. However, I can guide you on how to write a comprehensive README.md for your project based on standard practices and the information you've provided about the project.

A good README.md file serves as an introduction and guide to your project. It should provide enough information to get a new user started, as well as offer an overview of what the project does. Here's a template you can use and customize according to the specifics of your `go-electrum-client` project:
